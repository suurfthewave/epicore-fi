EPICORE is a deflationary cryptocurrency with a limited supply. 

Being a fork of and inspired by CORE, its main design principle is that yield generated should not lead to inflation, much like in many traditional markets. 

With improvements made on tokenomics and token governance, we hope to set a new standard where the strength of the coin is in the hands of the community.
